Hey folks, it has been way too long since I put fingers to keys ;^) but gratefuly for good reasons. We have been keeping very busy at the #C home, building beautiful products, making people happy, and most importantly, keeping the cats (that's right, double the fun) well fed. Chess is back on the menu, and it seems like we are pacing ourselves this time around, but the anxiety has not withered one bit. A minor setback was the terminal illness of our primary work machine, but we are still hoping it makes a full recovery. Its substitute is proving pretty decent (a shiny new MacBook pro), what with all the mobility convenience, zippy flash drive, and all that swank, but the warmth of the iMac is still not replaceable. Overall the boat is rocking, the birds are chirping, and life is good. See you soon!
