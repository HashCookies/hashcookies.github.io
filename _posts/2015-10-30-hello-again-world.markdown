Hey folks, it has been way to long since I put fingers to keys ;^) but gratefuly it's only for good reasons. We have been keeping very busy, building beautiful products thanks to our talents at the studio, making people happy, and most importantly, keeping the cats (that's right, double the fun) well fed. Chess is back on the menu. Seems like we are pacing ourselves this time around, but the anxiety still feels the same. A small setback was the terminal illness of our primary work machine, but we hope it makes a full recovery soon. Overall the boat is rocking, the birds are chirping, and life is good. See you soon!
