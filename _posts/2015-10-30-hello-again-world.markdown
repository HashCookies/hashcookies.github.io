Hey folks, it has been way too long since I've put fingers to keys ;^) but gratefully for all the good reasons. We have been keeping very busy at the #C home, building beautiful products, making people happy, and most importantly, keeping the cats (that's right, double the fun) well fed.[Chess](https://instagram.com/p/8bpk6CBu34/) is back on the menu, and it seems like we are pacing ourselves this time around, although the anxiety has not withered one bit. We had a minor setback, a terminal illness of our primary work machine, but like every hopeful parent,  I haven't given up on a full recovery. Its substitute is proving pretty decent, says [Milind](https://twitter.com/goobimama), but you'd have to agree that the warmth of an iMac is still not replaceable. Overall the boat is rocking, the birds are chirping, and life is good. See you soon!
