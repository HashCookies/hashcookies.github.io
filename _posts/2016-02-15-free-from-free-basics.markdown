Free Basics, a similar seductress like its twin Internet.org, came to us again as a noble cause; claiming to bring internet to the poor. But in a country like India where service operators providing the world wide web, unadulterated, unsupervised, for less than a rupee a day, it nearly is a right. Especially if you can afford a device to access it. Point being, if Facebook really had noble intentions, it could have availed a data pack to those less privileged, rather than pushing a bunch of curated websites, and since they practically then owned those who availed of free basics, they could feed you any content it seeemed fit. It was definitely a desperate attempt to prey on a rapidly growing media hungry audience.

The world wide web is an endless sea of knowledge and information from which a user can choose what to and what not to access, that is is the internet we have grown to love. The power of the people have fought to keep it that way, and victory is ours again. People 2, Facebook 0.
