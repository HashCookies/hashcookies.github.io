Free Basics, a similar seductress like its otherwise popularly known desguise -Internet.org, claiming that it would bring free internet to the poor. But in a country like India where service operators are providing the world wide web, unadulterated, unsupervised, for less than a rupee a day, the internet is nearly a right. Especially if you can afford a device to access it. Point being, if Facebook really had noble intentions, it could have availed a data pack to those less privileged, rather than pushing a bunch of curated websites, and since they practically owned that space, they could feed you any content it seeemed fit. It was clear that this was another desperate attempt to prey on a rapidly growing media hungry audience.
