The people have won again, and it’s a beautiful scene to witness that even one of the most powerful, influential companies, one loved by nearly every living webber, has crumbled in the battle against good, and now for the second time. Just about when Facebook was licking off their Internet.org wounds, Free Basics a similar seductress that came to us with the same so-called-noble cause, was sent back to where it belonged. 

Those who aren’t aware of what Free Basics is, I mean was :) to summarize, Facebook was to bring “free internet” to those in India who cannot afford it, albeit only a few handpicked websites, monitored by Facebook, and of course themselves being right at the centre of it. This meant that beautiful and useful products built by budding startups with little to no means to stroke Facebook’s monetary demands,  would be blocked to an audience who might’ve embraced it otherwise. Internet is extremely important, and in my opinion, it should be a right. In India, with service operators providing the world wide web, unadulterated, unsupervised, for less than a rupee a day, it nearly is. So if Facebook really had noble intentions, it should’ve have availed a data pack to those less privileged. But Free Basics seemed like a pretty straightforward business move to me, one that Facebook was trying to push their own products on to people who either cannot afford a basic internet package, or on to the social media hungry youth who would in reality be the biggest benefiters of this programme.

The world wide web is an endless sea of knowledge and information from which a user can choose what to access, that is how it should be, and the power of the people have fought to keep it that way. That essentially makes it People 2, Facebook 0.
