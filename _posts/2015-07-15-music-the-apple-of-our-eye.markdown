One major ingredient that drives our work is good music. All kinds of music. From the likes of the golden voice of Kishore da, right to electric Daft Punk, we love anything that makes our feet tap and keeps our brains oiled. Our head designer has been carrying the mantle as the Hash Cookies studio deejay, it's great that his taste in music is pretty versatile. And now thanks to [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/in/music/), we can listen to whatever we want, whenever we want. Life is good.

Currently, I'm totally digging the track **So wie du bist** *by MoTrip feat. Lary* that we came across in this [Beats Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1lfyFWW8fI). Wait for it!
