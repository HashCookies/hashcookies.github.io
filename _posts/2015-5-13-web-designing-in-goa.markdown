*"Web designing in Goa? Isn’t it a place to vacation?”*

Milind and I’ve had ample of opportunities to move out of the state, or for that matter the country, but we chose to stay rooted in Goa. I had a phase where I gigged in Mumbai for one long year, but as it was meant to be, country roads took me home. We are Goan boys, in body, mind and soul, but that is not the only reason we chose to set up base in Goa. Less traffic, more greenery, fresh air, and wide open spaces; we always wanted to have that, but more importantly, we wanted to be our own bosses. Goa gives you that liberty and several options. So we chose to run our studio out of a quaint village called Parra, not very far from the capital city. We struggled initially with internet, however options in the city then were pretty bad too. Now after 2 years, we have a prompt ISP, the business is smooth sailing, and our clients, well they really appreciate the serenity we chose to surround ourselves in. With most people today choosing to coordinate online, the relevance of where you’re located is very insignificant. We've made sure we have a very strong online communication system set up for that. But for those who decide to come visit us, they enjoy more than just a job well done.

*Web designing in Goa? Isn’t it a place to vacation?”* And so what if it is? Today, Goa nests a happy home for many startups. We saw it coming , we’re glad to call it home.
