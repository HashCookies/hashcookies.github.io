Hello beautiful people, we just finished up a creating a website for a finance management start-up. They call themselves Yellow Ledger and they're a cool bunch of people, very easy to work with and extremely meticulous with their work. They wanted us to reflect that into their website, and we did just that. From designing their logo to helping them out with copywriting, we covered a huge chunk of their branding assets. Do stroll over to [Yellow Ledger](http://yellowledger.com) and let us know what you think.

Adios.
