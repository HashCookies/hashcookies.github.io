This site--mostly raw HTML and CSS--is maintained using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted at [Github Pages](http://https://pages.github.com). We've used [Bootstrap](http://http://getbootstrap.com) for the scaffolding, [Typekit](http://https://typekit.com) to provide fonts ("Bree" and "Bree Serif"), and [skrollr](http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/) to help us animate around the place. The SVG shapes are all drawn using [Sketch for Mac](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), images polished in Photoshop and optimised in [ImageOptim](http://https://imageoptim.com). The code itself--including this line--is written mostly using [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/). Yes, I've heard of Sublime, but I'm stubborn. I have been dabbling with VIM with tmux on Ubuntu though.

The site was mostly designed while coding, rather than by drawing renders in Photoshop. The site went through many iterations before we landed on this one, which I think has a balance of playful while keeping it formal. Our intern Monica helped out with some of the vectors.
