This site--mostly raw HTML and CSS--is maintained using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted at [Github Pages](http://https://pages.github.com). We've used [Bootstrap](http://http://getbootstrap.com) for the scaffolding, [Typekit](http://https://typekit.com) to provide fonts ("Bree" and "Bree Serif"), and [skrollr](http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/) to help us animate around the place. The SVG shapes are all drawn using [Sketch for Mac](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), images polished in Photoshop and optimised in [ImageOptim](http://https://imageoptim.com). The code itself--including this line--is written mostly using [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/). Yes, I've heard of Sublime, but I'm stubborn. I have been dabbling with vim with tmux on Ubuntu though. The site, including this blog, is version controlled using git and hosted on github [here](https://github.com/HashCookies/hashcookies.github.io).

The site was mostly designed while coding, rather than by drawing renders in Photoshop. The site went through many iterations before we landed on this one, which I think has a balance of playful while keeping it formal. We did try and squeeze in as many Coldplay references we could get away with.
