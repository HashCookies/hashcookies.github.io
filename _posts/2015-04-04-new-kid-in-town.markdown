We've added a new member to the Hash Cookies team. Ravi is our new kid in town, a self taught web developer with a passion for challenges and thirst for learning new stuff. He works the [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) machine and among other things keeps tabs on cross-platforming fixes. Ravi told me that he too is a fan of Coldplay, which is a good thing, given that they are clearly worshipped at the studio. He is an Arsenal fan.. well, that's a flaw we can deal with (Screams out - Força Barça!). In all seriousness, he seems like a good fit to our little family and we certainly hope he enjoys his work here and the company that comes along with it.
