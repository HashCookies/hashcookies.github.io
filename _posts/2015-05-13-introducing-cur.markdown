 We are proud to introduce Cūr, a pain releief wearable that has officially launched in the USA. Hash Cookies was an integral part of the User Interface design team that built the iOS application. We are really excited for the Cūr team and wish them great success. 

Shaun Rahimi of Cūr on the product:

*It’s finally here. Meet Cūr, the world's first smart pain relief wearable. It senses pain to deliver TENS therapy for optimized and sustained relief. It’s small and discreet enough to be used anywhere on the body, whether you're watching a movie or playing sports. Effortless to use, all you have to do is place it and wait 5 seconds for effective relief. See the attached fact sheet for details.*
