Milind and I’ve had ample of opportunity to move out of the state, or for that matter the country, but we have so many reasons for staying rooted in Goa. I gigged for a bit in Mumbai, but as it was meant to be, Country roads took me home. We are Goan boys, in body, mind and soul; love the fresh air, wide open spaces, and the fact that you are never running against time. We always wanted to have that, and Goa gives you that liberty. With most people today choosing to coordinate online, the relevance of where you’re located is nearly insignificant. We've made sure we have a very strong online communication system set up for that. Hash Cookies - the studio, resides in a quaint village called Parra, which is not very far from the capital city. Of course, we have experienced a few hardships, but our state of mind, which is our most important tool, is costantly being serviced by chirping birds, peaceful silence, and the therapeutic purring of Porange, the cat.

Our clients who visit, they often compliment us on the serenity we chose to surround ourselves in. And small as it may seem, we love the sort of impression it has on them. Today, Goa nests a happy home for many new business owners, largely growing in the tech industry. We saw it coming, and we’re glad to call it the Hash Cookies' home.
