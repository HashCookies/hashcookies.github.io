Slacking, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Okay, let me clarify, I am talking about [Slack](http://slack.com), a communication platform for teams and companies. Hash Cookies tried a lot of task management services, including the old drawing board but [Slack](http://slack.com) instantly changed how we work. You can integrate the most popular services like [Github](http://github.com), [Trello](http://trello.com), [Dropbox](htpp://dropbox.com) and many more. And you can try all of this for free. Hash Cookies has stopped using email and instead share ideas, organise tasks and even use [Slack](http://slack.com) for regular office banter. Although we haven't been using it for too long, we don't see ourselves working any other way.
