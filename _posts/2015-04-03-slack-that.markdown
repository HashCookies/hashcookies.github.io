Slacking-- it's not necessarily a bad thing. Okay, let me clarify that I am talking about [Slack](http://slack.com), a platform for teams to communicate seamlessly. We at Hash Cookies tried a ton of task management services, including the old drawing board, but [Slack](http://slack.com) instantly changed how we work. You can integrate many of the most popular services like [Github](http://github.com), [Trello](http://trello.com), [Dropbox](htpp://dropbox.com) and a ton of others, and you do this all for free. We've long stopped using email and instead share ideas, organise tasks and even use [Slack](http://slack.com) for regular office banter. And although we haven't been using it for too long, we don't see ourselves working any other way.
