After being scattered all over the Alvares’ house for nearly two years, we got around to moving into a place of our own. Well, it’s still a part of the same house, and maybe it’s not really moving in so much as to moving two rooms down, but trust me when I say that this is finally a place we can call an office. 

Finding the right room in the house was the easiest part, how to make it look like a design studio was a different ball game altogether. No amount of research on Pinterest can help you prepare for this. Two guys trying to make calls on the perfect lamp shades, the right colour for the walls, placement of furniture, yada yada. And to add to the stress, when what you do is designing for a living, the outcome better be good. 

Here's a look into what was:

That being said, we welcomed the challenges, made a lots of mistakes but enjoyed the ride. We did a lot of the manual work ourselves, well not the heavy-lifting really, we had a young but promising contractor from the village help us out with that. It’s not a 100% complete, and I think it never will be, for Rober M. Pirsig put it so well *"Sometimes it's a little better to travel thank to arrive."*

Although, for now we do have a pretty decent place that you can come visit:

So if you're around, drop by for a cup of chai, or to chat about a whacky idea or maybe just to tickle the cat. They say we’re good company.
