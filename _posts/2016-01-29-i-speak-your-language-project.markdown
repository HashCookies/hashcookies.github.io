This was our very first project from the beautiful Australia, and we were really excited about it. [I Speak Your Language](http://ispeakyourlanguage.com.au) is a project geared towards helping ageing people from diverse background connect with medical or social services based on the language they are most comfortable speaking. Considering our core demographic, we designed a simple navigation and cross-platformed the web app for all devices. We used [ember.js](http://emberjs.com) to make the front end zippy, and the backend was called with the mighty [ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org). The project didnâ€™t just stop there. We built in a customized CMS for the admin, a subscription service for users to receive updates from service providers, designed a logo, and even designed simple auto response mailers. Hash Cookies took about 5 weeks to get the show on the road, while managing all communication online via Skype.
