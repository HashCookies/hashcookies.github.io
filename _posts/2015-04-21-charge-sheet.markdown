At Hash Cookies, we charge for our services by the hour. We put in all efforts in to delivering best version of a product, one that is designed with a good amount of research and creativity, and then carefully built with detailed precision. To compensate ourselves, we try to follow a pricing methodology, and this blog attempts to throw light on the how, what, and why of that process.

###The Concept:###
There are several stages we go through time and again to create that perfectly orchestrated product. We breakdown the entire process in stages so we can correctly compensate ourselves for all the effort we put in, and at the same time charge the client with a justifyable figure, rather than pulling it out of thin air. 

###The Breakdown:###
Every project we work on has its own identity, even though sometimes we may have dealt with a similar business in the past. This happens because they are influenced by various conditions; different demographics, cultures, ideologies are only a the tip of the iceberg. We have to put in time to learn about our client and their business, to help us figure out the best possible way to materialise their vision. We then sketch out those ideas to help them see our plan of action, build that product with the best available resources, while considering all the valuable feedbacks. Then make sure it works on all browsing platforms (no we don’t think *IE5* is a browsing platform), check carefully that it's accessible to everyone, and do all of this within a suitable timeframe. We do not charge our clients for any time partaken on learning on the job, or correcting errors made by us, or for the tea we make you when you show up at our humble abode. (*It’s so good, we should :-)*)

###The Advantage:###
Every client that chooses to work with Hash Cookies, walks out with a product that is custom made for them. That is the only way we know, and want to work. We never use readymade templates, and why should we? Creativity is a skill we harness. Charging by the hour gives us the liberty to think ‘out of the box’ every time we are approached for business. What can we do different? bigger? better? This nature of billing helps us find answers to these questions, and gives a client an understanding of the work we are putting in, which in-turn keeps them involved in the entire process. This results in smooth sailing of workflow, a solid service, and finally a product that will make you proud.
