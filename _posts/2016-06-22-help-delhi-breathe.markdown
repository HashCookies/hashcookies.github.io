Here’s [Help Delhi Breathe](http://www.helpdelhibreathe.in), a website that was designed and developed in 10 days! That’s right. It’s vibrant, it’s fast, and very easy to use. We were battling against a very crunched schedule, as our client had a few days remaining to their public launch and absolutely needed a website to launch an effective campaign. Ideas were discussed over [Slack](https://slack.com), wireframes designed in [Sketch](https://sketch.io), and a super awesome mobile friendly website built on a rails platform. Of course an integral part of the speed of delivery was the pace at which content was delivered and all the decisions were made. Most importantly, a now very happy client, put their faith in our expertise, and let us make all the design and technical decisions.

Here’s what the client had to say:
*Hash Cookies were amazing to work with – they produced very high quality work on an incredibly tight timeline and were wonderfully quick, responsive, and good humoured. It was a real pleasure collaborating with them and I absolutely hope to again!* [Read it on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hashcookies.social/reviews/)
