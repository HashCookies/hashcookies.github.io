Here’s Help Delhi Breathe, a [website](http://www.helpdelhibreathe.in) that was designed and developed in 10 days! That’s right. It’s vibrant, it’s fast, and very easy to use. We were battling against a very crunched schedule, as our client had a few days remaining to their public launch and absolutely needed a website to launch an effective campaign. Ideas were discussed over Slack, wireframes designed in Sketch, and a super awesome mobile friendly website built on a rails platform. Of course an integral part of the speed of delivery was the pace at which content was delivered and decisions were made. Most importantly, a now very happy client, put their faith in our expertise, and let us make all the design and technical decisions. 

Here’s what the client had to say:
*Hash Cookies were amazing to work with – they produced very high quality work on an incredibly tight timeline and were wonderfully quick, responsive, and good humoured. It was a real pleasure collaborating with them and I absolutely hope to again!* [Source](https://www.facebook.com/hashcookies.social/reviews/)

The world wide web is an endless sea of knowledge and information from which a user can choose what to and what not to access, that is is the internet we have grown to love. The power of the people have fought to keep it that way, and victory is ours again. People 2, Facebook 0.
