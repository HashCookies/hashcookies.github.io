We might be a little late to the celebrations, but Hash Cookies has always been supporters of the LGBT community. Love is for everyone, and the universe is just proving it to be true, one heartbeat at a time. We congratulate the Americans for taking the right step towards human equality, and of course all the countries that preceded them. We hope that someday we Indians can be part of the same cause. Love always wins.
