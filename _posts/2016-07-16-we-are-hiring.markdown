Hello World!

We at [Hash Cookies](http://hashcooki.es) are looking to hire object oriented developers, preferably someone who favors [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) or/and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com). We are not sticky about qualifications, but would love to see your experience on your GitHub repositories or any live websites you've built. But hey, if you don't have any, and still got the stones, you can come show it to us at our [studio](https://www.google.co.in/maps/dir/''/hash+cookies+google+maps/@15.5675299,73.7127305,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x3bbfea6877384119:0xee3ecec85417a514!2m2!1d73.782771!2d15.567541). We are also open to remote hiring if you fit the bill, thank God for [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Slack](https://slack.com). So if you love coding, are a team worker, a problem solver, and a decent human being, you can surely find a place in our family. [Write to us](mailto:fresh@hashcooki.es) or call +91 9637 443666.
