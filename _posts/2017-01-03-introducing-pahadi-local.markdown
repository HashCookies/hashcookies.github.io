[Pahadi Local](http://pahadilocal.com) is a startup based out of Mumbai. The brand communication was designed by a company in Mumbai who got in touch with us to help take them online while reflecting its brand details. We were handed over the content, there was an existing static website, and a short deadline. We went on to design a beautiful user interface cross platformed for all devices, built in an e-commerce platform with an admin dashboard to help manage the content easily, designing auto-mailers, stock management systems, flexible delivery options, the works. We used [Razorpay](http://razorpay.com) as its payment gateway. We used EmberJS alongside a rails server to build the product. Pahadi Local, now a client of Hash Cookies, shared a very positive feedback, and we are extremely thrilled to have delivered yet another product to our collection of everything beautiful.

If you are looking to take your business online, and present it in the most beautiful way, we have got you covered. [Get in touch](http://hashcooki.es/contact/).
